        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Moist and tender salmon with a slightly sweet and salty crustâ€”it's the perfect bite! This recipe is easy and
            a nice choice to serve for guests who aren't used to eating salmon. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh
            parsley and serve alongside rice pilaf or roasted sweet potatoes.</p>
